4. Direct message Kelsy Green on Slack if you have any food restrictions for group meeting lunches 
5. Message/e-mail your sub-group members to set-up a meeting to get research briefs on their work. Your sub-group members may also have extra shared drives to add you to - ask them! 
6. Check out the NOME google shared drive and familiarize yourself with the content in the drive - I may reference this over the summer

## Day 2

1. Download and get Python working on your computer. Doesn't matter if you use any type of editor, it just needs to be able to run. Figure out how to make a simple plot using matplotlib.
