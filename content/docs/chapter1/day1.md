A recommended reading list for the course.

## Day 1

use the #announcements Slack channel to introduce yourself
Use the #nome-research Slack channel to request tours for: MIBL, Alpha/Beta/Gamma Labs, PML polishing lab, & Cooley polishing labs from other NOME'rs
Fill out this form to get added to the group website
Direct message Kelsy Green on Slack if you have any food restrictions for group meeting lunches 
Message/e-mail your work coordinator (CC'ed) to set-up a meeting to get 15-30 minute research briefs on their work. Your work coordinators may also have extra shared drives to add you to - ask them! Work coordinators, please provide 1-3 papers/blog posts/etc. as material to review/familiarize the students about your project. Your summer work coordinators are:
Ian: Charles (Charlie) Hirst [LAMMPS, Data analysis, etc.]
Nicholas: Hangyu Li & Gabreilla Bruno (Hirst as backup) [discussions on getting YOLOv8, BAMFC, BAMFCv2 design]
Ben Arms: Wyatt Peterson & Mackenzie Warwick [discussions on creep testing and then outline stamp work]. Please include Kelsy Green in early conversations since she has the stamps.
Check out the NOME google shared drive and familiarize yourself with the content in the drive - I may reference this over the summer
