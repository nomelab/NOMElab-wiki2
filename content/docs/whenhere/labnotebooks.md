#General Information

##**Overview:** 


The key to a good notebook is that somebody else can learn exactly what you did and how you did it. It is not just your record, but it is the record for your colleagues. You are expected to keep a notebook as if you were a professional engineer.  In your subsequent career, the lab notebook will be important part of the intellectual property of your employer and could become critical evidence in a patent dispute. So remember that what you record must be easily understood by a person unfamiliar with your work many years later.

##General guidelines:

- Always use pen and write neatly, clearly, and in English
- Fill out all fields in the notebook including the book #, title, & project.
- Sign and date each entry
- If you make a mistake, place a SINGLE line through it and initial. You might need to read that mistake later so don’t try to erase/obliterate it!
- Bring your lab notebooks sheets to lab
- All entries made during the term will be scanned and uploaded twice per term for grading
- All pages must remain in the notebook - do not rip out pages or alter the notebooks. Do not skip pages.

##What to put in your lab notebooks:

- Procedures/methods applied for a particular experiment/samples preparation/microscopy session. (Example, what steps did you use to polish a sample?; what steps/procedure did you use for measuring a peak?)
- Observations. E.g. document everything that happened during that experiment/session. Include raw experimental data. Digitally generated data should be printed and taped on all four sides of the image in the notebook.
- Methods/algorithms/data manipulations used to interrupt and explore data (example, what method did you use to analyze a peak? Did you use Matlab? What data did you analyze? Where did you store the data? etc.)
-Sketches/drawings/schematics of your experiment. These can either be hand drawn (e.g. I always draw a “roadmap” of my material specimens and label the locations I took data from) and/or computer generated graphics (e.g. CAD drawings or workflow charts). Digitally generated graphics should be printed and taped on all four sides of the image in the notebook.
- Ideas for future experiments/efforts
- All other notes and information that are necessary to reproduce your results on whatever you are working on. More information is better!!!

##Ethics:

- All data must go into the notebook (includes “bad” data or failed experiments)
- The notebooks are property of the lab, although assigned to you. 
- The purpose of the notebook is to prove legitimate science and/or discovery and thus could be used in legal proceedings including patent applications, materials qualification standards, etc. The lab notebook is a critical system to adhering to Nuclear Quality and Assurance standards (e.g. NQA-1).
